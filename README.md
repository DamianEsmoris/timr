# Timr
_A sophisticated stopwatch made in Rust :crab:_

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use the program, build it and copy "backup.db" as "local.db" in the build folder. Repeat the same process for the ".env" file and the "static/" folder.

# What is Timr?
Timr is an app made for task tracking, providing both a CLI and a web view to manage your tasks more easily.

# Why Timr?
1. The name "Timr" was suggested by ChatGPT, and I think it's pretty catchy.
2. I chose to develop Timr as my first project in Rust to gain experience and create a cool implementation for my new Linux development environment.
